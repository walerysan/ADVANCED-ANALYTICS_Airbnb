# CF_ADVANCED-ANALYTICS_Airbnb
**Advanced analytics of Airbnb listings in Broward County, FL with Jupyter**<br>
_Analysis performed for learning purposes with CareerFoundry educational platform_

In this analysis, I have explored the main metrics of the rental listings available on the Airbnb platform to build an **interactive dashboard** that will visually showcase well-curated results of an **advanced exploratory analysis** conducted in Python. 

The open-source dataset comes from the [www.insideairbnb.com](http://insideairbnb.com/about.html), a project that uses web scraping methods to collect the data. For this analysis, I used the set with properties that were listed on September 27th, 2021. For the geographical visualization, I used the geojson file from the project's website. 

In the 6 exercises, I performed operations from cleaning and understanding the data, through correlation diagrams, machine learning algorithms used for regression and cluster analysis, to time series and tests the data for possible predictions.

The repository consists of:
1. Project brief
2. Data sets
3. Scripts

The insights are presented in Tableau's [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anna.walerys/viz/Airbnb_16358848257400/Airbnb?publish=yes).
